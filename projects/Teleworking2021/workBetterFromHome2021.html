                                Effective Individual contribution to team-based collaboration in the virtual work environment (VWE) relies on mutual trust. People tend to accept and trust others when they first meet each other. In contrast, consolidation of long-lasting trust depends on satisfying people’s expectancy in commitment fulfillment. In the conventional workplace, the continuous witness of the process that someone is fulfilling their commitment is the key factor in strengthening one’s trust in another. However, due to concerns in ethics and technology limitations, watching other people working at home is not possible in the virtual work environment. Therefore, reviewing people’s workflow at a behavioral level provides new solutions for developing interpersonal communication (witness of the process of commitment fulfillment), goal attainment (commitment fulfillment), and mutual trust in the virtual work environment. As a result of this thesis, there are 6 typical types of work behavior found, and 10 design guidelines for the virtual work environment are concluded.

                                This project can satisfy people who are working in different industries (Guideline 1). And it also matches Guideline 3 by using email as the method to communicating with different people to break down the barrier of platforms. Also, because of balancing the needs of work-related conversations and non-work-related conversations, the design offers users the opportunity to have “small talk” with their coworkers (Guideline 5), which makes bonds tight in online working. It's also a help to inspire the establishing of "Mediation Space" (Guideline 9). And for sure, by using goal-oriented conversation, the design can reduce distractive conversations.

                                    In the conclusion of this brief history of workplace development, it is clear that the workplace’s development process has evolved from centralizing the workforce and dividing positions to considering “employees morale”, from merely focusing on efficiency to including humanity and productivity.

                                    The enhancement of individual power is driven by both economy and technology. According to a World Economic Forum report before the coronavirus pandemic, businesses had already expressed a desire to increase their flexibility in engaging workers. The respondents in the report expected the application of companies’ decentralized operations could introduce jobs such as “project-based, temporary and freelancing roles”.

                                    The lines that connect central brainstormed ideas, the top five trends, and the bottom five needs show whether the concept meets future trends and basic demands of workplaces. The more connections related to the 5 trends, the more the idea adapts to the future society. The more connections that are related to the 5 needs, the function of the idea is more compatible with the demand for a functional workplace. Therefore, as the figure suggests, workplaces in the near- term future may be Home Office and Mobile Office, which are both directly related to creating a virtual work environment (VWE).

                                    To learn whether my prediction reflects the actual trends of peo- ple’s workplace and their life change. I did three interviews about people’s workplace. The research question for this transgenerational research is How the Relationship Between Workplace And People in China Changes Through Time. The reason I focus on China is the work condition and purpose changes rapidly from rural economy to modern economy, which could made it easy to get access to a primary material for the varying workplace. There are three people engaged in this research as interviewees and they are respectively present three different generations.

                                    The lines that connect central brainstormed ideas, the top five trends, and the bottom five needs show whether the concept meets future trends and basic demands of workplaces. The more connections related to the 5 trends, the more the idea adapts to the future society. The more connections that are related to the 5 needs, the function of the idea is more compatible with the demand for a functional workplace. Therefore, as the figure suggests, workplaces in the near- term future may be Home Office and Mobile Office, which are both directly related to creating a virtual work environment (VWE).
